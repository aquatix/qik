Customizing

Pages, sections, news and tiles are located in the /site subdirectory. If you
add a page to the /site/pages directory, give it a name in the form of
<sectionname>_<pagename>.html , for example home_welcome.html . Add it to the
section file /site/sections/home.desc as "welcome=Welcome at my site" for
example.

There are two CSS [Cascading Style Sheets] files located in the /css directory.
You can modify style.css to your likings. struct.css is for setting up the
general structure of the pages, and can of course be edited too, but that
shouldn't be necessairy.

For this purpose you can also modify /site/pagetemplate.php which contains the
general html frame of the pages, and the code of the navigation and sub
navigation.

You can also create news files in the /site/news directory. For example,
/site/news/home.desc will be used when you put the tag @@@news=home:2:5@@@ in
your page. The 2 and 5 stand for the item it will start and end. You can also
ignore the second number, than it will start at 2 and output all items. If you
only do a @@@news=home@@@ all items will be shown.

Pages can include snippets too. These are called tiles and can be included by
putting a tag of the form @@@tile=todo@@@ in a page. This will include the
contents of /site/tiles/todo.html into your current page. Useful for reusing
certain pieces, for example.
